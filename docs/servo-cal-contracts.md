# servo-cal data contracts

Wire formats between klippy (orchestration), `servo-cal` (analysis), and the
dashboard. Implementations must match this file; change the file first if a
schema has to move. Companion plan:
[servo-calibration-automation.md](servo-calibration-automation.md).

## Run directory

One experiment (one command invocation) = one directory:

```
<captures_root>/<tag>_<YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS>/
  manifest.json                 # klippy, written before the first stroke
  step_<step>.scap.zst          # one per step (zstd-compressed at write time)
  step_<step>_accel.csv         # optional, next to its step
  results.json                  # servo-cal analyze
  plot_series.json              # servo-cal analyze
```

`captures_root` default: `~/printer_data/logs/servo_captures`.

`belts` is null off corexy. `accel` is null when no accelerometer recorded.
A `differential` run's `stroke_plan` instead holds the chirp:
`{"belt": "A", "freq_start": 20.0, "freq_end": 250.0, "hz_per_sec": 5.0,
"duration": 46.0, "ramp": 1.5, "amplitude": 0.05, "dwell_ms": 500}`; `axis`
is the belt letter, `motors` lists the pair in slot order and `belts` is
null.
A `ringdown` run (`SERVO_MEASURE_RINGDOWN`) sweeps stroke speed: its
`stroke_plan` is `{"center": 110.0, "speed": null, "speeds": [100, 400],
"accel": 20000.0, "iterations": 3, "dwell_ms": 1500, "cruise_ms": 200,
"accel_chip": "adxl345 tool"}` (`accel_chip` null without one). Strokes
are centered on `center`, each the shortest length that reaches cruise
speed and holds it `cruise_ms` before the stop
(`v²/a + v·cruise_ms`, recorded per step as `swept.stroke_mm`) — the test
never sweeps the whole bed. The strokes run with post-processors bypassed
and the jerk limit lifted (engine `set_post_processor_bypass` /
`set_jerk_override`, both restored after), so the stop excites the raw
closed-loop plant. Each step additionally carries
`"stops": [print_time, ...]` — the commanded-stop print-time of every
stroke, read off the motion fence before the dwell, `iterations * 2` per
step. The analyzer windows accelerometer ring-down tails from these;
servo tails come from the capture's own target-motion segments, and a
count mismatch between stops, strokes and the plan is a hard error.
`ambient.journal_params` holds the readback of every
`[servo_calibration] journal_params:` address per captured drive, taken at
run start. `ambient.notches` is always recorded per captured drive, also at
run start: the adaptive-notch mode (C01.30) and all five notch filters'
center frequency / width / depth (C01.40–4E), read back from the drive so a
run can later answer "what notches were active". Missing readback is a hard
error, not an omitted key. The dashboard's "ambient diff vs previous" column
diffs this block (as `notchN.field: before→after`) alongside
`journal_params`, skipping notch comparison against runs that predate the
block.

  }
}
```

`combined` is null off corexy, `accel` null without a recording.
`verdict.recommended_step` / `apply` are null when no step qualifies —
`reason` then says why. Resonance: moving-segment following-error PSD, power
ratio of the 20–450 Hz band peak to the 1–4 Hz band mean, detected at ratio
≥ 8.0 (ports the kalico repo's `scripts/servo_gain_report.py` before its deletion).

Each `metrics.moves[]` entry has this schema:

```json
{"move": 0, "start_ms": 299.0, "end_ms": 1129.0,
 "direction": 1, "ferr_mean_moving": 12.5,
 "ferr_peak": 1738.0, "ferr_rms": 299.45, "overshoot": 482.0,
 "settle_ms": 107.0, "settle_window_truncated": false}
```

`direction` is -1, 0, or +1 from the actual target displacement
`target_counts[e-1] - target_counts[s-1]` for move window `[s,e)`; a bridged
or merged zero-net segment remains 0. `ferr_mean_moving` is the signed mean
following error over exactly `[s,e)`, excluding feedforward lead and the
post-move settling window. Peak and RMS retain their existing extended-window
semantics.

A `differential` step instead carries an empty `drives` map and a
`differential` block — the anti-phase belt-pair FRF (H1 Welch estimate,
differential commanded position → differential encoder position, drive
signs from the capture header's `invert`):

```json
{"differential": {"pair": ["motor_a", "motor_a1"], "segments": 12,
  "modes": [{"freq_hz": 42.1, "gain": 3.2, "gain_db": 10.1,
             "damping": 0.031, "coherence": 0.94}]}}
```

Modes are strict local maxima of |FRF| inside the commanded band with
coherence ≥ 0.5, deduped within max(3 Hz, 5%), at most 5, sorted by
frequency; `damping` is the half-power ratio (null when a half-power
crossing leaves the estimate). The verdict recommends nothing and lists the
modes in `reason`. Its plot step adds a `differential` block (band-restricted
arrays): `{"freq_hz": [..], "mag_db": [..], "phase_deg": [..],
"coherence": [..], "torque_db": [..], "coherence_min": 0.5,
"band": [20.0, 250.0], "modes": [..]}` — the per-drive `psd`/time series are
computed over the chirp's active span rather than motion-flag segments.

A `ringdown` step carries the normal `drives`/`accel` blocks plus a
`ringdown` block — the free-decay modal fit of every post-stop tail
(guard 10 ms after the commanded stop, window `dwell_ms − 50 ms`):

```json
{"ringdown": {"guard_ms": 10.0, "window_ms": 1450.0, "sources": [
  {"source": "combined|<drive>|accel_x|accel_y|accel_z",
   "unit": "um|mm/s2", "tails": 6, "noise_floor": 4.9,
   "modes": [{"freq_hz": 41.2, "zeta": 0.031, "zeta_lo": 0.029,
              "zeta_hi": 0.034, "amp": 2218.7, "disp_um": 0.42,
              "tails": 6, "cycles": 20.1, "r2": 0.95,
              "fit_start_ms": 30.3}]}]}}
```

Per tail, each Welch-PSD peak (≥ 6× the 10–450 Hz band median) is
band-isolated via an FFT analytic signal (even-reflected edges; a
wide-band refit when the decay outruns the isolation filter), and the log
envelope + unwrapped phase give decay rate and damped frequency — hence
natural `freq_hz` and damping ratio `zeta`. Fits below 3 cycles, R² < 0.5
or incoherent phase are dropped; modes seen in fewer than two tails are
noise (unless the source has a single tail). Per-source modes are the
per-tail fits clustered within max(3 Hz, 6%), medians reported, `zeta_lo`/
`zeta_hi` the spread, `amp` the envelope at fit start in source units and
`disp_um` the residual displacement it implies. Servo sources are
following error in µm (plus the belt-combined on-axis series on corexy);
accelerometer sources are per-axis mm/s². A mode with negative `zeta`
flags the step `ringdown_growing_oscillation`. The verdict recommends
nothing; `reason` carries the dominant mode of the most informative source
(accelerometer over combined over drives) and the shaper parameters it
implies. Its plot step adds a `ringdown` block:
`{"sources": [{"source", "unit", "modes": [..],
"psd_freq_hz": [..], "psd": [..]` (mean tail PSD)`,
"tails": [{"start_s", "t_ms": [..], "value": [..]}]` (headline sources
only, ≤ 4 tails, ≤ 800 points each, trimmed to the informative span —
the plot ends once every ~5 ms block of every tail sits at the noise
floor, padded 30%, ≥ 100 ms — so a fast ring is not squeezed against the
left edge of a mostly-quiet window)`,
"envelope_t_ms": [..], "envelope": [..]}]}` — the dominant-mode decay
envelope over the first tail's time grid.

## plot_series.json (version 1, servo-cal writes)

Downsampled for drawing, ≤ 2000 points per series (stride, no averaging).

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "steps": [{
    "name": "p880_s550_i2273",
    "fs_hz": 4000.0,
    "stride": 8,
    "t_s": [0.0, 0.002],
    "moving": [[0.035, 1.119]],
    "drives": {"motor_a": {"ferr_counts": [..], "torque_per_mille": [..]}},
    "combined": {"on_ferr_mm": [..], "cross_ferr_mm": [..]},
    "accel": {"t_s": [..], "magnitude": [..]},
    "psd": {"freq_hz": [..], "per_drive": {"motor_a": [..]},
            "accel": {"freq_hz": [..], "psd": [..]} }
  }]
}
```

`psd` is the full moving-segment following-error Welch PSD per drive — the
same `(freqs, psd)` arrays `resonance` in `results.json` is computed from, not
recomputed or downsampled (`≤ 2000` bins, same cap as the other series but
never stride-thinned since Welch already caps bins around 513). `freq_hz` is
shared by every drive. `psd.accel` is null without an accelerometer
recording, otherwise the accel-magnitude PSD on its own frequency grid.

## servo-cal CLI

```
servo-cal analyze <run-dir>            # writes results.json + plot_series.json,
                                       # prints the metrics table
servo-cal analyze --scap <file.scap>   # single capture, table to stdout
servo-cal analyze ... --dump-csv PATH  # raw per-drive series as CSV
servo-cal fit ...                      # servo-ident fit, --capture takes .scap
servo-cal serve --dir <captures_root> [--port 8085]
                [--live-sock /tmp/kalico-ethercat.sock.live]
```

Exit non-zero with a one-line reason on any malformed input (fail loud, no
partial results.json). The calibration extension resolves the binary at
`target/snapshot/servo-cal` relative to this repo root, overridable via
`[servo_calibration] servo_cal_binary:`.

`serve` endpoints: `GET /api/runs` (list: name, mtime, experiment, verdict
summary), `GET /api/runs/<name>/manifest|results|plot_series`,
`GET /api/runs/<name>/path` (full-resolution commanded/actual XY per step,
computed from the raw captures on request, values rounded to 1e-4 mm,
≤ 500000 points per step with a `truncated` flag when the cap bites),
`POST /api/runs/<name>/analyze` (run analyze if results.json missing or
stale), `GET /` static SPA. G-code submission goes browser → Moonraker
(`POST /printer/gcode/script`), not through servo-cal.

## Live telemetry tap (ethercat-rt ↔ servo-cal)

The ethercat-rt endpoint in the kalico repo
(`rust/ethercat-rt/src/live_tap.rs`) binds a second unix socket at
`<control-socket>.live` (default `/tmp/kalico-ethercat.sock.live`, mode
0666). Per connection it writes one scap-v2 header line — exactly
`capture::header_json`, drives named `slot0..slotN` since motor names live in
klippy config — then streams fixed-size capture records while
the client stays connected. One client at a time; `servo-cal serve` is
that client (`--live-sock`), and fans the data out to browsers over
`/api/live_tap`.

The DC thread pushes records only while a client is connected, through
a bounded preallocated channel; overflow drops records rather than
stalling the cycle or failing the session, and every drop is visible to
the consumer as a `cycle_index` jump (records carry the absolute DC
cycle counter). A reconnect gets a fresh header; `cycle_index` continues
from the same running counter. Consumers must render jumps as gaps.

## Tuning profile

`~/printer_data/config/servo_tuning/<name>.params` — same line syntax as a
`[motor] params:` block (`parse_params_block`), `#` comment lines carry
provenance (run dir, created_utc, metrics summary). Referenced as
`[motor] tuning_profile: <name>`, pushed at claim time before the `params:`
block; an address present in both is a config error.

## Structured log events (subsystem `calibration`)

- `calibration.run_start` — `run_dir`, `experiment`, `tag`, `axis`
- `calibration.run_done` — `run_dir`, `recommended_step`, `flags`,
  `duration_s`
- `calibration.autotune_stage` — `stage`, `run_dir`, `outcome`
